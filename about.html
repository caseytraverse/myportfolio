         <p class="about"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Growing up,</span> I was always very fond of both Art and English class. Art was where my visual imagination could run wild on canvas. English was where I could communicate emotion through pen and paper.</p>
         <p><span class="separate">/ / /</span></p>
         <p class="about">When I was 12 years old <span style="font-weight: bold;">I had spent</span> the better part of that year trying to convince my father that our family needed to join the elite few in town who owned a desktop computer with... internet access!</p>
         <p class="about">I had spent <span style="font-weight: bold;">a lot of time</span> on Windows Paint before we got our fancy new computer so when I discovered Adobe’s Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Flash - it was as if I had discovered a hidden buried treasure. While other kids were playing video games I was <span style="font-weight: bold;">learning HTML and designing websites.</span></p>
         <p><span class="separate">/ / /</span></p>
         <p class="about"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Some 15 years later</span> I formed my organic bath and body soap company while living on Maui, Hawaii. I decided to build the company website myself thinking back to my experience over a dozen years prior. “How much could have changed in 15 years?” I asked myself.</p>
         <p class="about">Well, a lot - come to find out. Via a lot of trial and error, countless tutorials and google searches <span style="font-weight: bold;">I successfully</span> created my companies website.</p>
         <p><span class="separate">/ / /</span></p>
         <p class="about">Recognizing how much had evolved, I set out to embrace these new challenges. In 2019 I <span style="font-weight: bold;">completed a twenty-month mentorship at Bloc</span>. The apprenticeship focused on UI/UX Design with the foundations of Frontend Development. Creating friendly visual designs that offer real-world solutions was not what I would have thought I was setting out to do all those years ago. But as it turns out - it was.</p>
