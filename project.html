         <plight>An existing client had come to the agency with an idea for a new project. They had the core of an idea, but there was still a lot of unanswered questions about the specific direction for the project.</plight>
         <plight>With the sector still being young, the client felt there was room for another player in the cloud storage and organizational market. The client wants to enhance the user experience with collaborative and social sharing tools. The client needed further user research in this market and a brand identity. It was my pleasure to help with the design and brand development.</plight>

         <h3 class="anchor">the problem</h3>
         <plight>Currently, there is not a cloud storage service that does it all. It can be frustrating switching between various apps to perform different tasks. Users are looking for an all-in-one collaborative cloud storage platform that is secure and easy to use.</plight>

         <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
         <plight>Firstly, I needed to gather information about the existing market. I began by completing a competitive analysis of three well established existing companies. After thorough research and understanding of the competitive landscape I was able to determine the best way for a competitor to enter the marketplace. </plight>

       </div>
       <div class="case-body eight-column">
         <plight>The cloud storage market has been a rapidly growing market for over a decade. I focused my analysis on three of the biggest companies in this sector.</plight>
       </div>
     </div>
     <div class="row case-image">
       <div class="cs-img eight-column">

       </div>
     </div>
       <div class="case-body eight-column">
         <plight>While each three companies offer different things to the market, none of them are the one-stop shops that users are searching for. Google Drive allows you to store, create, and share content. Apple’s iCloud is primarily a store and share app. Pinterest is a visual sharing and organizational app.</plight>
         <plight>While there are many cloud storage services on the market, there’s still room for growth, like alto, to enter the market and make some waves.</plight>
         <plight>I then created the user flows for the three companies Apple’s iCloud, Pinterest and Google Drive. This helped me to identify the priorities of the competitors and what they're directing users towards.</plight>

       </div>

         <h2>User Survey's</h2>
         <plight>To better acquaint myself with the users wants and needs I conducted a user survey. I distributed the survey across various social media platforms (Facebook, Reddit, Twitter) to gather enough responses to make user personas and user stories.</plight>
         <plight>In the survey, I focused on the following aspects:</plight><br>
         <ul class="case-ulist-style">
           <li>Which features they value the most</li>
           <li>Which cloud storage platform the users use</li>
           <li>What are some features that could enhance their experience</li>
           <li>What additional collaborative features they would like to see offered</li>
           <li>If they use collaborative features on their cloud storage service</li>
        </ul>
       </div>

                <h2>User Persona's</h2>
                <plight>After conducting the user surveys, I created two user personas to embody the typical users for this platform. I did this by analyzing the patterns found in my research.</plight>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <plight>Using the data from both my competitive analysis and user surveys, I was able to create informed user stories. I compiled a list of tasks that new and returning users need to complete when they would use the site. I ordered the tasks from high, medium to low priority.</plight>
        <div class="row case-image">
          <div class="cs-img eight-column">
              <img src="images/alto-image-7.png" alt="User Stories"/>
            <div class="cs-caption two-column">
              <p>User stories were compiled.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
          <h2>User Flows</h2>
          <plight>In order to visualize my user stories I followed by creating user flows. User flows are the visualized conception of the steps, or path the user would take navigating specific tasks on a website or app.</plight>
          <plight>I converted all of my high priority user stories as well as some medium priority user stories into user flows. This helped assist me to visualize the processes that are necessary to be completed for a minimum viable product. </plight>
          <div class="row case-image">
            <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                <img src="images/alto-image-8.png" alt="User Flows"/>
              <div class="cs-caption two-column">
                <p>Organizing files - user flow.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
            <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
            <plight>To ensure that each destination in the user flows was represented, I was compiled a sitemap for the website.</plight>
            <div class="row case-image">
              <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                  <img src="images/alto-image-9.png" alt="Sitemap"/>
                <div class="cs-caption two-column">
                  <p>Sitemap for alto.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <plight>After this I started thinking about the visual content for the site. Feedback received from my user surveys indicated a minimalistic and user friendly platform was most optimal. With this in mind I designed my wireframes to reflect that.</plight>
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <plight>I began by sketching out the wireframes. Once I had a rough idea of how those would look, I digitized them to Figma.</plight>
            <div class="row case-image">
              <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                  <img src="images/alto-image-10.png" alt="Wireframes"/>
                <div class="cs-caption two-column">
                  <p>Digitized mockups.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
              <h2>Clickable prototype</h2>
              <plight>Prototyping allows me to create an interactive prototype for users to test and provide feedback on without the need to develop a complete website.</plight>
              <plight>In order to test the features I created I needed to create a prototype to test with users to validate my decisions.</plight>
              <div class="row case-image">
                <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                    <img src="images/alto-image-11.png" alt="Mockup"/>
                  <div class="cs-caption two-column">
                    <p>Mockup.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div>
                <h2>Usability testing</h2>
                <plight>Usability testing is very valuable to the process as it helps you understand what may or may not be working in your design before it gets too far.  This feedback helped me conceptualize my visual design for my high fidelity prototype.</plight>
                <h2>Branding - Research & Sketching</h2>
                <plight>It was necessary that the branding message conveys a sense of safety, security and dependability. This was seen as an important aspect for a cloud storage brand to possess according to research data. I used this as my inspiration as I began to sketch out various logo designs.</plight>
                <plight>I decided to name the platform alto, after altocumulus clouds. alto is short, modern and simple.</plight>
                <div class="row case-image">
                  <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                      <img src="images/alto-image-12.png" alt="Logo Sketches"/>

                  </div>
                </div>
                  <h2>Branding - Refinement & Moodboard</h2>
                  <plight>To further refine my initial concepts and explore how to express the emotional aspects of the brand visually, I created a moodboard.</plight>
                  <plight>I was also able to narrow down to two potential typefaces, Poppins and Roboto. I chose these specifically due to their minimalistic and modern design. These attributes are also reflected in my moodboard.</plight>
                  <div class="row case-image">
                    <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                        <img src="images/alto-image-13.png" alt="Moodboard"/>
                      <div class="cs-caption two-column">
                        <p>Moodboard.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                    <h2>Branding - Color palettes & Style guides</h2>
                    <plight>Moving forward I needed to determine the color pallete and decide on a typeface.</plight>
                    <ul class="case-ulist-style">
                      <li>HEX#109CF1 Dodger Blue was selected for it symbolizes intelligence, trust and confidence.</li>
                      <li>Poppins was selected for its clean and open feel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><plight>To present my brand story for the client to review I created a style guide. I structured all of these different items into one cohesive guide, to display the full range of work I did on the branding.</plight>
                    <div class="row case-image">
                      <div class="cs-img eight-column">
                          <img src="images/alto-image-14.png" alt="Style guide"/>

                      </div>
                    </div>
                      <h2>High fidelity prototype</h2>
                      <plight>Incorporating the feedback from my low fidelity user tests, I began designing the high fidelity mockup. Using my style guide as my model, I showcased the colors in the palette to help accentuate the branding.</plight>
                      <div class="row case-image">

                        <plight>Before testing my high fidelity mockup, I conducted preference tests on three different iterations of a few design elements. I tested user preferences on the dashboard layout, sidebar design and readability.</plight>

                          <plight>After additional design revisions based off of the preference testing data, I was able to move forward with another round of usability testing. I tested my high fidelity prototype with three seperate users.</plight>

                            <plight>Using the data compiled through usability testing, preference tests and the feedback received I made quite a few revisions throughout the design process. I will explain the various edits that were made and the reasoning behind each revision.</plight>

                                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                                    <plight>This project was a challenge for me, however, the experience was incredibly valuable. Going into this project I was a bit apprehensive as the client brief was extremely vague. My biggest concern was in regards to materializing an idea with so little direction.</plight>
                                    <plight>What I soon learned surprised me the most about this experience. Even without a clear vision for a project, you can still find a purposeful direction utilizing the resources of user research.</plight>
                                    <plight>Throughout the design process, I was highly impacted by how important user testing is. Of course I would know how to navigate and use a website I designed. But how would a new user react to the flow of the website? That was the most useful and interesting information to collect. </plight>
                                    <plight>What seemed to work was both brand recognition and the overall usability of the site. What I needed to work the most on was the visual hierarchy and the contrast/readability of the site.</plight>
                                    <plight>If I had more time I would have expanded my usability testing to more users from around the globe. For my usability testing I chose participants readily available to me, which narrowed my testing to a smaller geographical location.</plight>
                                    <plight>Ultimately, I think this project showcases my abilities to accualized an ambiguous client brief into a fully conceptualized finished design.</plight>
