         <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
         <p class="light">Firstly, I needed to gather information about the existing market. I began by completing a competitive analysis of three well established existing companies. After thorough research and understanding of the competitive landscape, I was able to determine the best way for a competitor to enter the marketplace.</p>

         <p>Competitive Analysis marketplace conclusion.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="case-body eight-column">
         <p class="light">The cloud storage market has been a rapidly growing market for over a decade. I focused my analysis on three of the biggest companies in this sector.</p>
       </div>
     </div>
     <div class="row case-image">
       <div class="cs-img eight-column">
           <img src="images/alto-image-2.png" alt="Three Competitors" class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="100ms"/>
       <div class="cs-caption two-column">
         <p>Google's Drive. Apple's iCloud. Pinterest.</p>
       </div>
     </div>
       <div class="case-body eight-column">
         <p class="light">While all three companies offer different options to the market, none of them are the one-stop shops that users are searching for. Google Drive allows you to store, create, and share content. Apple’s iCloud is primarily a store and share app. Pinterest is a visual sharing and organizational app.</p>
         <p class="light">While there are many cloud storage services on the market, there’s still room for growth, like alto, to enter the market and make some waves.</p>
         <p class="light">I then created the user flows for the three companies Apple’s iCloud, Pinterest and Google Drive. This helped me to identify the priorities of the competitors and what they're directing users towards.</p>

         <h2>User Survey's</h2>
         <p class="light">To better acquaint myself with the user's wants and needs I conducted a user survey. I distributed the survey across various social media platforms (Facebook, Reddit, Twitter) to gather enough responses to make user personas and user stories.</p>
         <p class="light">In the survey, I focused on the following aspects:</p><br>
         <ul class="case-ulist-style">
           <li>Which features they value the most</li>
           <li>Which cloud storage platform the users use</li>
           <li>What are some features that could enhance their experience</li>
           <li>What additional collaborative features they would like to see offered</li>
           <li>If they use collaborative features on their cloud storage service</li>

                <h4>Motivations:</h4>
                <p class="light">Karen was provided with a Chromebook for her classroom and uses Google Drive to access all her classes school materials, assignments, tests and grading forms. She finds it very convenient to have her classes curriculum and all associated materials accessible from any device and everywhere she goes. Karen also owns an iPhone, iPad, and iWatch so she also has an Apple iCloud account. She uses this account to backup and synchronizes her photos, videos, notes, music and more across all her Apple devices. Karen loves DIY gardening projects and draws a lot of her inspiration from Pinterest. She finds Pinterest especially useful for organizing ideas, DIY gardening, and home projects.</p>
                <h4>Goals:</h4>
                <ul class="case-ulist-style">
                  <li>Printing files from the cloud</li>

                <h4>Quotes:</h4>
                <p class="light">“Google Drive stores all of my necessary classroom documents. It’s extremely useful for having my class materials available to me wherever I go!”</p>

            <h4>Motivations:</h4>
            <p class="light">Greg spends most of his work time on a laptop or computer. He analyzes various articles, research papers, scientific-technical developments, and records relevant data. Greg finds it complicated keeping track and organizing all of his research papers, articles, sources, etc. He uses Google Drive and Dropbox to categorize his research materials but dreams of an auto-organize feature to save him time from doing this. He uses Google Drives collaborative features to organize data via Google Sheets, writes research papers via Google Docs and shares files with his research team. Greg owns an iPhone and iPad so he also has an Apple iCloud account. He uses this account to store his personal/private photos, videos, notes, music, media, Apple Pay and more across all his Apple devices.</p>

              <li>Privacy/security concerns</li>
              <li>No auto-organizing of files to folders</li>
              <li>Not enough storage space for all of his files</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Bio:</h4>
            <p class="light">Greg is a 25-year-old bachelor from Los Angeles, California. He works as a research associate for CBRE. In his free time, Greg likes to watch his favorite basketball team, the LA Lakers play. He also is a big foodie and loves trying new restaurants, attending concerts, live music events and frequents sports bars. Whether it be buying tickets to the LA Lakers or getting an Uber home from the bars Greg uses Apple Pay on his iPhone which he carries everywhere.</p>
            <h4>Quotes:</h4>
            <p class="light">“I love the ease of having all of my cards connected to my phone. My iPhone has replaced my wallet!”</p><br><br><br>

        <h2>User Stories</h2>
        <p class="light">Using the data from both my competitive analysis and user surveys, I was able to create informed user stories. I compiled a list of tasks that new and returning users need to complete when they would use the site. I ordered the tasks from high, medium to low priority.</p>

          <p class="light">To visualize my user stories I followed by creating user flows. User flows are the visualized conception of the steps, or the path the user would take navigating specific tasks on a website or app.</p>
          <p class="light">I converted all of my high priority user stories as well as some medium priority user stories into user flows. This helped assist me to visualize the processes that are necessary to be completed for a minimum viable product.</p>

            <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
            <p class="light">To ensure that each destination in the user flows was represented, I was compiled a sitemap for the website.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="light">After this, I started thinking about the visual content for the site. Feedback received from my user surveys indicated a minimalistic and user-friendly platform was most optimal. With this in mind, I designed my wireframes to reflect that.</p>

              <h2>Clickable prototype</h2>
              <p class="light">Prototyping allows me to create an interactive prototype for users to test and provide feedback without the need to develop a complete website. To test the features I created I needed to create a prototype to test with users to validate my decisions.</p>

                <h2>Usability testing</h2>
                <p class="light">Usability testing is very valuable to the process as it helps you understand what may or may not be working in your design before it gets too far.  This feedback helped me conceptualize my visual design for my high fidelity prototype.</p>
                <h2>Branding - Research & Sketching</h2>
                <p class="light">The branding message needed to convey a sense of safety, security, and dependability. This was seen as an important aspect for a cloud storage brand to possess according to research data. I used this as my inspiration as I began to sketch out various logo designs.</p>
                <p class="light">I decided to name the platform alto, after altocumulus clouds. alto is short, modern and simple.</p>

                  <h2>Branding - Refinement & Mood board</h2>
                  <p class="light">To further refine my initial concepts and explore how to express the emotional aspects of the brand visually, I created a mood board</p>
                  <p class="light">I was also able to narrow down to two potential typefaces, Poppins and Roboto. I chose these specifically due to their minimalistic and modern design. These attributes are also reflected in my mood board.</p>

                    <h2>Branding - Color palettes & Style guides</h2>
                    <p class="light">Moving forward I needed to determine the color palette and decide on a typeface.</p>
                    <ul class="case-ulist-style">
                      <li>HEX#109CF1 Dodger Blue was selected for it symbolizes intelligence, trust, and confidence.</li>
                      <li>Poppins was selected for its clean and open feel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br><p class="light">To present my brand story for the client to review I created a style guide. I structured all of these different items into one cohesive guide, to display the full range of work I did on the branding.</p>

                      <p class="light">Incorporating the feedback from my low fidelity user tests, I began designing the high fidelity mockup. Using my style guide as my model, I showcased the colors in the palette to help accentuate the branding.</p>

                                    <p class="light">This project was a challenge for me, however, the experience was incredibly valuable. Going into this project I was a bit apprehensive as the client brief was extremely vague. My biggest concern was in regards to materializing an idea with so little direction.</p>
                                    <p class="light">What I soon learned surprised me the most about this experience. Even without a clear vision for a project, you can still find a purposeful direction utilizing the resources of user research.</p>
                                    <p class="light">Throughout the design process, I was highly impacted by how important user testing is. Of course, I would know how to navigate and use a website I designed. But how would a new user react to the flow of the website? That was the most useful and interesting information to collect.</p>
                                    <p class="light">What seemed to work was both brand recognition and the overall usability of the site. What I needed to work the most on was the visual hierarchy and the contrast/readability of the site.</p>
                                    <p class="light">If I had more time I would have expanded my usability testing to more users from around the globe. For my usability testing, I chose participants readily available to me, which narrowed my testing to a smaller geographical location.</p>
                                    <p class="light">Ultimately, I think this project showcases my abilities to actualize an ambiguous client brief into a fully conceptualized finished design.</p>
